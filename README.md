Visualization of public data concerning wages paid to public employees in the county of Ribeirão Preto - São Paulo, BR. There we can see in multiple ways how the employees are distributed by secretariats and roles and how some roles receive higher wages. Also we can see whose roles are most present than others.

The data was extracted and adjusted for our purpouses in Python (Jupyter Notebook) in march/23 from: https://www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br/administracao/quadro-funcional-salarios-completo
